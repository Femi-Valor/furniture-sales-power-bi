### Data Cleaning Process in Power Query
- **Removed Duplicates**: Ensured the uniqueness of records by checking against Order ID and Product ID.
- **Data Types**: Converted columns such as Order Date and Ship Date to proper Date format, and ensured Sales, Quantity, and Profit were numeric.
- **Null Handling**: Replaced missing values in categorical fields (e.g., City, State, Region) with “Unknown”.
- **Derived Columns**: Extracted Month and Year from Order Date for time-series analysis, and also duration.
- **Text Standardization**: Cleaned up inconsistent entries in Category and Sub-Category fields for accurate grouping.
